I earned my Bachelor’s of Science in Astronautical Engineering from the US Air Force Academy.  
My education at the Academy exposed me to this wide field and I became very interested in control systems, astrodynamics and rocket propulsion.  
I found the ability to model, predict, and control the output of a system to be incredibly fascinating.  
I believe the knowledge of control theory can be applied to a wide variety of problems as well as issues well outside the realm of Aeronautics or Astronautics. 
As a member of the United States Air Force I’ve been exposed to the program management aspects of space systems.  
My goal is to transition towards the research and development of advanced spacecraft by pursuing a graduate degree and future doctoral degree.  
I hope to further my understanding of control and dynamics and continue research in this field.    My interests in these fields have led me to applying to Purdue University.  
As a full time member of the Air Force a quality distance learning program in this field was very important to me.  
Purdue University allows me to continue my education and pursue my dreams while still working full time for the Air Force.  
I believe that the Aeronautics and Astronautics Department at Purdue University is the ideal place to complete my graduate degree. 
The expert faculty and highly regarded program make Purdue University a excellent opportunity to continue my studies.  
I can directly apply the information learned in my graduate studies to the current issues on operational systems for the Air Force. I plan applying the knowledge from this graduate degree to further advance current space systems in the Air Force.  
After my career in the Air Force I hope to pursue a doctoral degree and become a professor or work for the private industry.  
The combination of a world class education and applicable experience in a space related field would prove useful to a professor.
